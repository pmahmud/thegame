## [Issues](https://github.com/snakeop/thegame/issues)

Issues are created [here](https://github.com/snakeop/thegame/issues).

### Issue Maintenance and Closure
* If an issue is inactive for 45 days (no activity of any kind), it will be
marked for closure with `stale`.
* If after this label is applied, no further activity occurs in the next 7 days,
the issue will be closed.
  * If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant, feel free to
  ping a maintainer or add a comment!

### Languages

We accept issues in *any* language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply. 
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.

**Please note** that using non-English as an attempt to circumvent our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will be an immediate, and possibly indefinite, ban from the project.
