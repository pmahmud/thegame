The game "Snakes on a plane" brings you the traditional game Snakes with a twist. It is a computer game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. It is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) and is used by the [Atom
editor](https://github.com/atom/atom) and many other [apps](https://electronjs.org/apps).
