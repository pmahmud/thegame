# Order is important. The LAST matching pattern has the MOST precedence.
# gitignore style patterns are used, not globs.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
